Serves: 4-6

####Ingredients
* 8 eggs, whisked
* 1 sweet potato or yam, shredded
* 1lb US Wellness Meats Pork Sausage, broken up
* 1 yellow onion, diced
* 1 tablespoon garlic powder
* 2 teaspoons dried basil
* salt and pepper, to taste
* any extra veggies you want to put in there: peppers, squash, etc.

####Instructions

1. Grease crockpot with a bit of coconut oil to make sure none of the egg stuck to it.
2. Shred your sweet potato. 
3. Add all ingredients to your crockpot and use a spoon to mix well.
4. Place on low for 6-8 hours. I cooked it for more than 7 to make sure the pork sausage was completely cooked through.
